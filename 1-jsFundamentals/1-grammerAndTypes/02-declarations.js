    notes on variables: (used for data containers- to store information)
        -a variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
        -numbers may follow the above characters, num cannot come first.
        -javascript is case sensitive - 'hello' and 'Hello' are different variables.
        -no spaces are allowed in variable names.
        -camelCase is the best practice for naming variables.
